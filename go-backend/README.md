**About Stoplight**

Launched in 2015 at Techstars Austin, [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io) offers a wide range of API tools to thousands of developers and organizations all over the world. Our customers are all trying to solve the same problem: how to deliver automation, collaboration, and quality services across a large technical organization operating in this new API centric world. We have hundreds of customers, including SendGrid, Chargify, Zendesk, Quicken, Symantec, and Blackboard.

Stoplight is changing the way that developers work by accelerating API development and improving API collaboration across teams. The Stoplight platform is built on top of a modern technology stack, including node, go, react, electron, kubernetes, and docker.

*We think about APIs first, do you?*

**What We Do**

Great tech teams know that the next step in web development is integration – to the cloud, between applications, and between layers of the technical stack. Here at Stoplight, we believe that speed, repeatability, and scalability are central to any tech team’s mission. To enable the success of technical organizations, Stoplight has created an end-to-end platform to support:

* Collaboration on the creation, modeling, and governance of APIs across large organizations.
* Automated API testing.
* Automated, beautiful API documentation.
* API virtualization, mocking, and orchestration.
